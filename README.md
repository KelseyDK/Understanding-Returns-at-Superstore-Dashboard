# Understanding-Returns-at-Superstore-Dashboard
This project focuses on building a standalone interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze Superstoreâ€™s product return trends.
# Introduction:
I used filters and KPIs to allow dynamic exploration of return rates by category, sub-category, region, and segment. The dashboard also highlights the relationship between discounts and return likelihood.
# Takeaways:
The dashboard empowers business users to easily identify high-risk products and customer segments, enabling faster, data-driven decisions.
# Recommendations:
Integrating return analysis into the regular sales review cycle could help the company take a proactive approach to returns and customer retention.
